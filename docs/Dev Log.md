- had a frustrating day with my database, spent nearly 3 hours talking to varsha with not much working
- we had trouble deleting the old buyer/seller id from my database, we did eventually, but couldnt change them to foreign keys to the user_id column of users, and couldnt re-add them as such
- ended up fixing it a few hours later on my own thanks to an amazing doc i found
- was finally able to delete the old columns of my listings table and re-add them as foreign keys
- installed more gems - simpleform, bootstrap
